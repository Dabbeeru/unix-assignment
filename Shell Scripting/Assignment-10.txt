Create a script that, when run, will accept two command line values as arguments. These arguments should be a username and password and assigned to two variables in the script named appropriately. Finally, echo those values out to the terminal when run to indicate they were read and assigned as expected.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter username"
read n
username=$n

echo " Enter password"
read m
password=$m

echo 'username is :' $username
echo 'password is :' $password
