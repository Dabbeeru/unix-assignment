Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.

#! /bin/bash


firstsentence='Setting User variable to current logged in user'
secendsentence='Setting pwd to present working directory'

echo 'First sentence is ' $firstsentence
echo 'Second sentence  is '$secondsentence >> /dev/null
