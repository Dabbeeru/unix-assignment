Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3. Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable. Be sure to display the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to follow instructions. Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null (to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter number between 1-3: "
read number
a=1
b=2
c=3
if [ $number == $a ] || [ $number == $b ] || [ $number == $c ]
then
   echo "Number is between 1-3 and number is: "  $number
else
   echo "Number is not between 1-3 and entered number is: " $number
