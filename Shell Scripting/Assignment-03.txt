Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run. Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, using inline comments, what each command is doing.


#!/bin/bash
# This script clears the terminal, displays a greeting and gives information
# about currently connected users.  The two example variables are set and displayed.

clear                           # clear terminal window

echo "The script starts now."

echo "Hi, $USER!"               # dollar sign is used to get content of variable
echo

echo "I will now fetch you a list of connected users:"
echo
w                               # show who is logged on and
echo                            # what they are doing

echo "I'm setting two variables now."
MYUSERNAME="laxmi"                                      # set a local shell variable
MYPASSWORD="passwd"                                     # set a local shell variable
echo "This is a string: $MYUSERNAME"                    # display content of variable
echo "And this is a number: $MYPASSWORD"                # display content of variable
echo

echo "I'm giving you back your prompt now."
